- 👋 Hi, I’m @Merchant228
  I write what I would call urban prose poetry on my blog liferaftintheabyss.com.
  But before that I founded an L3C company for the purpose of financing home businesses, so that people
  struggling with an minimum wage can become their own boss creating wealth for themselves and their families in 2016.

  And honestly, I failed miserably.
  Then along came crypto, and I have a chance to to succeed.

  I need all the help I can get.
